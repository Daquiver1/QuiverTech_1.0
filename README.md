# QuiverTech Thursday Challenges - Cipher Challenge

Welcome to the first challenge in our QuiverTech Thursday Hacks! For this phase, the goal is to introduce you to the basic concepts of encryption and decryption, skills that are crucial for understanding data security and cryptography. By completing this phase, you will unlock your next clue which will lead you to a Google Doc file.

## What is Encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access. This means taking plaintext, like a regular text message, and scrambling it into ciphertext, which looks like a random series of letters, numbers, and symbols.

## What is Decryption?

Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back into its original form, so it's understandable again. It's the reverse process of encryption.

## Basic Encryption Techniques - The Caesar Cipher

One of the simplest forms of encryption is the Caesar Cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a Caesar Cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' would become 'B', 'B' would become 'C', and so on.

### How to Decrypt a Caesar Cipher?

To decrypt a Caesar cipher, you simply shift the ciphertext letters in the opposite direction by the same number of places as they were shifted during encryption.

## Challenge Task

Below is a message that has been encrypted using a Caesar Cipher with a shift of 3. Decrypt this message to find your next clue!
